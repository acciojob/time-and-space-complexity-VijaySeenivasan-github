 <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
 <p>Time  complexity is a type of computational complexity that describes the time required to execute an algorithm. The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time it takes for each statement to complete. As a result, it is highly dependent on the size of the processed data.The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number of operations is considered the most efficient one in terms of the time complexity.</p>
 <p><b>Space complexity refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution. Calculate the space occupied by variables in an algorithm/program to determine space complexity.Space complexity of O(n) means that for each input element there may be up to a fixed number of k bytes allocated, i.e. the amount of memory needed to run the algorithm grows no faster than linearly at k*N.</b></p>
